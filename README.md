### Functional Programming in C#

Notes based on the book [Functional Programming in C# by Enrico Buonanno](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp-second-edition)

#### Goals
- [ ] Use higher-order functions to achieve more with less code and reduce duplication;
- [ ] Use pure functions to write code that is easy to test and optimize;
- [ ] Write APIs that are pleasant to consume and accurately describe your program’ behavior;
- [ ] Use dedicated types to handle nullability, system errors, and validation rules in a  that’s elegant and predictable;
- [ ] Write testable, modular code that can be composed without the overhead of an IoC container;
- [ ] Write a Web API in a functional style;
- [ ] Write complex programs with simple, declarative code, using high-level functions to process elements in a sequence or a stream of values;
- [ ] Read and understand literature written for functional languages;
